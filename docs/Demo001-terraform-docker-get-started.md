## Demo 001 terraform docker-get-started
Following hashicorp [terraform docker-get-started](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/docker-build?in=terraform/docker-get-started) guide


### main.tf

```
[c7-master:root:~/learn-terraform-docker-container] # cat main.tf 
terraform {
  required_providers {
    docker = {
      source = "kreuzwerker/docker"
      version = "~> 2.13.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "docker" {}

resource "docker_image" "nginx" {
  name         = "nginx:latest"
  keep_locally = false
}

resource "docker_container" "nginx" {
  image = docker_image.nginx.latest
  name  = "tutorial"
  ports {
    internal = 80
    external = 8000
  }
}
```
### terraform init
```
[c7-master:root:~/learn-terraform-docker-container] # terraform init

Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Finding kreuzwerker/docker versions matching "~> 2.13.0"...
- Installing kreuzwerker/docker v2.13.0...
- Installed kreuzwerker/docker v2.13.0 (self-signed, key ID 24E54F214569A8A5)

Partner and community providers are signed by their developers.
If you'd like to know more about provider signing, you can read about it here:
https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli/plugins/signing.html

Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
```
### terraform plan
```
[c7-master:root:~/learn-terraform-docker-container] # time terraform plan

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # docker_container.nginx will be created
  + resource "docker_container" "nginx" {

Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run "terraform apply" now.
